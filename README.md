[Integrating UX Design methodologies into software development](https://www.creative-tim.com/blog/web-design/bootstrap-background-image/)

I found this article to be interesting because it discusses the importance of having UX Design methodolgies in Agile software Development as well as a misunderstanding about UX. UX Design has to do with understanding, communicating, and providing for the end-user's needs in a product. There are often misunderstandings of the job of a UX designer, believing that they deal with UI or designs. A UX designer, however, works on the behalf of the end-user and researches user behavior to maximize the end-user's experience with the product. As such, it is important for the whole team to understand the UX Design methodolgies as well as Agile methodolgies. Communication and collaboration are essential to the success of the product.
